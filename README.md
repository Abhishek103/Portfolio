# Portfolio
This is a portfolio of all my Data Analytics projects

R is the main Language used in execution of Analysis and Machine Learning. Projects in Python will be added to the portfolio soon. Every .ipnb file has an explanation about the problem, why and what analysis was done and the business implication of the end result.
